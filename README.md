## 🚀 About this Project

This project is a plug-and-play infrastructure setup designed for any VPS. It combines the power of **Traefik** for reverse proxy and SSL, a complete **monitoring stack** (Prometheus + Grafana), and **containerized databases** — all wired together with Docker.

Whether you're spinning up a dev environment or preparing for production, this setup helps you launch fast, stay secure, and keep everything under control.

## 🕸️ Docker Network Design

This project uses **three isolated Docker networks** to provide clean architecture and enhance security:

- **`production`** — for core infrastructure services like Traefik, Prometheus, and Portainer  
- **`databases`** — for database containers such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis  
- **`application`** — for your actual app containers (API, frontend, workers, etc.)
- **`Monitoring`** — for the Exporter's and Grafana

Each container is connected only to the networks it needs — reducing attack surfaces and keeping your infrastructure modular and maintainable.

## 🛠️ Useful Commands

A collection of handy commands to help you manage your infrastructure and server setup.

---

## 🔐 SSH Key Management

**Generate a new SSH key (no passphrase):**
```bash

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_ci -N ""

```

**View the private key:**
```bash

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_ci

```

**View the public key:**
```bash

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_ci.pub

```

**Add the public key to the server (as root):**
Append the .pub content to:
```bash

/root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

**Set correct permissions on the server:**
```bash

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

```
---

## 🧪 Generate Basic Auth Password for Traefik Dashboard

**Use the command below to create a hashed password for use with basic auth in Traefik:**
```bash

htpasswd -nbB yourusername yourpassword

```
Example output: admin:$2y$05$abc123...longhash...

Use this in your Traefik middleware config for securing the dashboard.


---

### 🔗 Docker Networks

**Create a Docker network:**
```bash

docker network create <network-name>

```

**List all Docker networks:**
```bash

docker network ls

```

---

### 📄 Traefik Logs


**Follow Traefik logs:**
```bash

docker logs -f traefik

```

**Filter Traefik logs for certificate activity:**
```bash

docker logs -f traefik | grep certificate

```
